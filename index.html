            <h2>What Robert Caro Taught Me About Power, Policy, and AI Governance</h2>
            <p><strong>There is no great policy victory without a war for power.</strong> That is the central lesson of Robert Caro’s work—whether it is Robert Moses reshaping New York’s physical infrastructure or Lyndon Johnson reshaping its moral one. Caro doesn’t merely document history; he dissects the anatomy of power: how it is acquired, how it is maintained, and how it is used to bend institutions to one’s will. But beneath this realist framework lies a subtler insight—one that thinkers like Hobbes and Machiavelli knew well, and that political theorists like Locke, Rawls, and Arendt tried to temper: power, to be effective, must operate within a story. It must make sense not only on paper but to people. Today, as we confront the question of how to govern artificial intelligence—a technology that threatens to move faster than our institutions can react—the challenge is not merely technical or legal. It is narrative, strategic, and deeply human.</p>
            <p>Reading Caro’s biographies of Moses and Johnson, one quickly comes to see that policy success depends on the synthesis of three distinct elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technically sound policy</strong>: It must work as intended and survive legal and bureaucratic scrutiny.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative coherence</strong>: It must resonate with people, fitting into a broader story about what our political community is and what it is for.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic realpolitik</strong>: It must be maneuvered through a terrain of incentives, opposition, alliances, and inertia.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This tripartite model is not merely academic. It is the lived reality of Caro’s protagonists.</p>
            <p><strong>Robert Moses</strong> represents the fusion of technical expertise and bureaucratic cunning. He understood law, architecture, finance, and institutional arcana. He drafted legislation that was nearly impossible to revise, and he embedded his authority in the obscure folds of administrative agencies. But he did so largely without public mandate or narrative persuasion. His power was real, but not always democratic.</p>
            <p><strong>Lyndon Johnson</strong>, by contrast, was the master of legislative maneuver. He knew the personal ambitions, fears, and petty grievances of every senator. He orchestrated the passage of civil rights legislation not through eloquence but through influence, timing, and leverage. He did not write the policies himself—he had teams of experts for that—but he knew how to attach those policies to a story: that the arc of American history demanded justice.</p>
            <p>What Caro reveals in both cases is that policy change is not a function of good ideas alone. It is a function of good ideas embedded in persuasive narratives, executed by power-conscious actors. As a law student writing on AI regulation and insurance, I find this framework incredibly clarifying. Because when we talk about AI governance, too often we reduce it to a matter of compliance: technical standards, model audits, regulatory schemes. These are necessary, but insufficient.</p>
            <p>We also need to think about <strong>how AI policy is sold</strong>, to the public and to legislators. What is the story we are telling? Is AI safety just another form of tech skepticism, or is it part of a broader humanist vision—that we wish to remain the authors of our own future? And finally, we must think about how to make AI policy <strong>stick</strong>. What bureaucracies will enforce it? What incentives will shape its implementation? Who benefits, and who resists?</p>
            <p>There is a danger, too, in narrative disruption. Kafka understood this. In <em>The Trial</em>, his protagonist is formally part of the legal system—he has rights, he is ostensibly equal—but the system remains illegible, alien, disjointed. That sense of bureaucratic alienation, I argued in a recent paper, reflected Kafka’s experience as a Jew in Central Europe whose legal status was rapidly changing. Emancipation brought rights, but it also collapsed an old story, and no clear new one emerged. The reaction was ferocious.</p>
            <p>We saw something similar in the United States after the Civil Rights Act. Equal rights on paper took decades to realize in practice. The social script was rewritten, but the actors didn’t all know their new lines. Narrative whiplash produces backlash.</p>
            <p>AI may well present a similar rupture. If machines write our books, make our films, generate our art, and shape our speech, what happens to our story of what it means to be human? And how do we ensure that any legal framework governing AI accounts not only for technical risk but for the psychological, cultural, and civilizational stakes?</p>
            <p>Caro teaches us that power is not a pure force. It is a composite of law, language, and leverage. If we want to govern AI—rather than be governed by it—we will need all three. We will need engineers and ethicists. But we will also need storytellers, coalition-builders, and policy tacticians. We will need Robert Moses, Lyndon Johnson, and yes, Robert Caro too.</p>
