  <h2>Soul, Self, and Niche</h2>
  <p><strong>The question <em>What am I?</em> usually returns three types of answers:</strong> <em>soul</em>, <em>self</em>, and <em>niche</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>The soul</strong> is the classical answer. It names an essence, an intrinsic form, a kind of ontological fingerprint. For Aristotle and Aquinas, the soul is not a ghost but a <em>form</em>—the principle that gives life and identity to the body. Not a substance added to matter, but a structure internal to it. In this view, the soul is given, not chosen. It is discovered through philosophy or revelation, not invented through expression. It defines what you are in relation to universal kinds—human, rational, mortal, etc.</p>

  <p><strong>The self</strong> is the modern answer. It emphasizes experience, narrative, and continuity. The self is what persists through time and change, what owns memories, what suffers or triumphs. It is the “I” that introspection refers to. Descartes grounded it in thought; Hume dismantled it into bundles of impressions. Contemporary psychology treats it as a construction—partly real, partly reactive. Buddhism denies its permanence, seeing it as a conceptual fiction generated by craving and attachment. Whether you see the self as sacred or simulated, it’s usually conceived as interior and bounded.</p>

  <p><strong>The niche</strong> is the ecological answer. It shifts attention from what you are to the <em>conditions under which you exist</em>. A niche is not an essence or an ego but a relational structure: a pattern of dependencies, affordances, pressures, and roles that shape and sustain a way of being. Biologically, a niche describes the role a species plays in an ecosystem. But the idea generalizes. You can talk about intellectual niches, economic niches, emotional niches. Where the self is internal, the niche is <strong>situated</strong>.</p>

  <p>What’s useful about the niche concept is that it <strong>externalizes identity without dissolving agency</strong>. You are not a pure actor with complete autonomy, nor a passive node being acted upon. You are a pattern co-produced by your environment. Change the niche, and the person changes too. This creates a powerful framework for personal transformation: not through introspection or willpower alone, but through <em>ecological redesign</em>. If you want to write more, build a writing niche. If you want to become more reflective, build a reflective niche. Architecture, media, habits, relationships—all of these shape the self by shaping the niche.</p>

  <p>In this light, the self is more like a <em>phenomenological footprint</em> of a niche. The soul is your form; the self is your story; the niche is your context. All three are real, but they operate at different levels of abstraction. Where classical metaphysics asked <em>What is man?</em>, the niche question is <em>Under what conditions does this version of man emerge?</em> It’s not a denial of essence, just a refusal to treat essence as self-contained.</p>

  <h3>Related Concepts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extended mind hypothesis</strong> (Clark & Chalmers): cognition as distributed across brain, body, and environment</li>
    <li><strong>Foucault’s “apparatuses”</strong>: structures of discourse and institution that shape subjectivity</li>
    <li><strong>Erving Goffman’s dramaturgical model</strong>: identity as role-playing within staged contexts</li>
    <li><strong>Ecological psychology</strong> (Gibson): perception as affordance-based interaction with the environment</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Practical Implications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't just ask “Who am I?”—ask “What sort of world do I stabilize?”</li>
    <li>Self-improvement is not always internal growth; it can be <strong>niche engineering</strong></li>
    <li>The “search for self” may be better understood as <strong>a search for a viable mode of situated being</strong></li>
