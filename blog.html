  <h1>My first principle of prompt engineering</h1>
 <p>
        I’ve noticed a pattern with people who either warn me about using ChatGPT or mess up when trying to use it. 
        The problem isn’t the tool—it’s how they’re using it. They treat it like some magical oracle: type a vague 
        question, get a vague answer, and then either trust it completely or dismiss it entirely. Neither of these 
        approaches works well.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I use ChatGPT, I treat it like a helpful but sometimes forgetful assistant. For example, if I want it 
        to create an essay problem about subject matter jurisdiction in federal civil procedure, I don’t just ask for 
        the problem outright. Instead, I start with something like, “What do you know about subject matter jurisdiction?” 
        I then compare its response to my notes. This helps me make sure it understands what I’m asking before I rely 
        on its output.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of it like using a search engine. If you’re looking for the “Parable of the Law” in Kafka’s <em>The Trial</em>, 
        you might first try searching “parable of the law” directly. Sometimes that works; sometimes it doesn’t. A better 
        method might involve searching for “Kafka The Trial,” finding the text, and then using Ctrl+F to locate the specific 
        section. If the first method doesn’t work, that doesn’t mean search engines are bad—it just means you need a better 
        strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same principle applies to ChatGPT. When people hear that I use it, they often assume I just type in a question 
        and accept the first answer. But that’s not how I approach any source of information—not even encyclopedias or 
        dictionaries. If I look something up, I usually double-check it elsewhere. That’s not distrust; it’s just good practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to using ChatGPT effectively is simple: ask good questions, think critically about the answers, and refine 
        your approach as needed. It’s not a magic oracle, but it can be a powerful tool if you guide it properly. In fact, 
        the process of testing and refining its responses forces you to think more clearly, which is valuable in its own right.
    </p>
    <p>
        So no, ChatGPT isn’t perfect. But neither are we. Treat it like a collaborator that sometimes needs coaching, and 
        you’ll get a lot more out of it.
