          <h2>What Robert Caro Taught Me About Power, Policy, and AI Governance</h2>
      <p><strong>There is no great policy victory without a war for power.</strong> That is the central lesson of Robert Caro’s work—whether it is Robert Moses reshaping New York’s physical infrastructure or Lyndon Johnson reshaping its moral one. Caro doesn’t merely document history; he dissects the anatomy of power: how it is acquired, how it is maintained, and how it is used to bend institutions to one’s will.</p>
      <p>Reading Caro’s biographies of Moses and Johnson, one quickly comes to see that policy success depends on the synthesis of three distinct elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technically sound policy</strong>: It must work as intended and survive legal and bureaucratic scrutiny.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative coherence</strong>: It must resonate with people, fitting into a broader story about what our political community is and what it is for.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic realpolitik</strong>: It must be maneuvered through a terrain of incentives, opposition, alliances, and inertia.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What Caro reveals is that policy change is not a function of good ideas alone. It is a function of good ideas embedded in persuasive narratives, executed by power-conscious actors.</p>
